# Botnet Detection using Machine Learning Classifier Algorithms

Objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning Classifier model using different ML Classifier Algorithms avaialble and perform botnet detection using them on the CTU-13 Dataset. Below ML Classifier Algorithms are used.

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Naive Bayes Classifier 
3. Logistic Regression Classifier
4. Random Forest Classifier
